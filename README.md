# Pumpkin
**About Dataset:**

The notebook is about the use of machine learning methods in **classification** of pumpkin seeds.Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution.Pumpkin seeds are rich in the right amount of protein, fat, carbohydrate and mineral contents. The research was carried out on two of the most important and qualitative species of pumpkin seeds:"Urgup_Sivrisi" and "Cercevelik". They are widely grown in the Urgup and Karacaoren regions of Turkey. Considering morphological features of 2500 pumpkin seeds of both varieties, 

I subjected all data to modeling of known methods of supervised machine learning (classification):
* Logistic Regression
* Regularization L2
* KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor)
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)
* Naive Bayes
* Decision tree
* Random Forest

which determined the most effective method of classifying pumpkin seed varieties.
